      { question: "What is React?", answer: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces." },
      { question: "How do you create a React component?", answer: "You can create a React component either as a function or as a className." },
      { question: "What is JSX?", answer: "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML directly within React." },
      { question: "What are props in React?", answer: "Props are inputs to a React component that are passed down from a parent component." },
      { question: "What is state in React?", answer: "State is a built-in object that stores data or information about the component." },
      { question: "How do you update the state in React?", answer: "State in React can be updated using the `setState` function in className components or the `useState` hook in function components." },
      { question: "What is the difference between props and state?", answer: "Props are immutable and are passed from parent to child components, while state is mutable and managed within the component." },
      { question: "What is a React hook?", answer: "React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components." },
      { question: "What is the useEffect hook?", answer: "The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in function components, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation." },
      { question: "How do you handle forms in React?", answer: "Forms in React are typically controlled components, where the form data is handled by the state within the component." },
      { question: "What is the virtual DOM?", answer: "The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize updates and rendering." },
      { question: "How does React handle events?", answer: "React handles events through synthetic events, which are cross-browser wrappers around the browser's native event system." },
      { question: "What is React Router?", answer: "React Router is a library for routing in React applications, allowing you to navigate between different components or pages." },
      { question: "What is the purpose of keys in React?", answer: "Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed when rendering lists of elements." },
      { question: "How do you optimize performance in a React application?", answer: "Performance in React can be optimized by using techniques like code splitting, memoization, lazy loading, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders." }

        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
